## Topics

### Global Exception Handler

The global exception handler is a mechanism to handle exceptions that are not caught by the application code. It is a good practice to have a global exception handler to handle uncaught exceptions and log them. This will help in identifying and fixing issues in the application.

Go to the snippet: [Global Exception Handler](ExceptionHandlers/GlobalExceptionHandler.md)

### Serilog Structured Logger with AWS Sink

Logging is an essential part of any application. It helps in identifying issues, monitoring performance, and tracking user behavior. Serilog is a popular logging library for .NET applications. It provides a structured logging approach, which makes it easier to analyze logs and extract useful information.

This section provides an example of how to use Serilog with the AWS sink to log structured logs to AWS CloudWatch.
